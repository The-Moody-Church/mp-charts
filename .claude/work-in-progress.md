# Work in Progress

## MP Auth: User Token Pass-Through (2026-02-20) — Issue #7

### Status: ⚠️ IN PROGRESS (Code complete, needs live testing)

**Problem**: All API calls used the API Client User's credentials (client_credentials grant), so:
1. Audit logs showed "API User" instead of the actual logged-in user
2. Users could see data their MP account shouldn't have access to (e.g., background checks)
3. `$userId` query parameter was passed but MP doesn't honor it for audit attribution

**Fix**: Modified the full stack to use the logged-in user's OIDC access token (already captured in the NextAuth session) for API calls instead of client credentials.

**Architecture changes**:
- `MinistryPlatformClient` — supports user access token mode (skips client_credentials refresh)
- `MinistryPlatformProvider` — added `withAccessToken()` factory (non-singleton)
- `MPHelper` — constructor accepts `{ accessToken }` option
- All 6 services — `getInstance(accessToken?)` creates per-request instances with user token
- All server actions — pass `session.accessToken` to `getInstance()`
- Dashboard cached lookups remain on client credentials (aggregate data, no user context in `unstable_cache`)
- JWT callback in `auth.ts` remains on client credentials (runs during login before session exists)

**Files modified**: `client.ts`, `provider.ts`, `helper.ts`, `index.ts`, 6 services, 6 action files, `shared-actions/user.ts`

**What still needs testing**:
- Verify audit logs in MP show the actual user name
- Verify users with restricted MP permissions get appropriate 403 errors
- Verify background check data is hidden from users without BG_Check table access
- Verify the user's token refresh works correctly for long sessions

## Production Image & MP Link Fix (2026-02-20) — Issues #30, #31

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Root cause**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars used in `"use client"` components were inlined as `undefined` during Docker build (Dockerfile doesn't set them at build time). Works in dev because `next dev` reads `.env.local` at runtime.

**Fix**: Created `RuntimeConfigProvider` context — server component reads env vars at runtime, passes to client components via React context. All client-side `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` references replaced with `useRuntimeConfig()` hook.

**Files created**: `src/contexts/runtime-config-context.tsx`
**Files modified**: `src/contexts/index.ts`, `src/app/providers.tsx`, `src/app/(web)/layout.tsx`, `src/components/volunteer-processing/volunteer-card.tsx`, `src/components/volunteer-processing/volunteer-detail-modal.tsx`, `src/components/layout/header.tsx`, `src/components/contact-lookup-details/contact-lookup-details.tsx`, `src/components/contact-lookup/contact-lookup-results.tsx`

## Volunteer Processing (2026-02-19) — Branch: `feature/volunteer-processing`

### Status: ✅ Feature Complete — Deployed to Production

**Implementation**: Full volunteer processing dashboard with:
- Tab 1 (New Volunteers In Process) — production
- Tab 2 (Approved Active Volunteers) — production, with group name filter dropdown
- Detail modal with checklist, background check details, quick actions for milestones & application creation
- Expandable checklist items (milestones, certifications, form responses) showing notes and file attachments
- Attachment indicator (paperclip icon) on collapsed items when files exist
- File size validation (1 MB limit) with user-facing error message
- "View in MP" link in modal header
- 10-item checklist per volunteer (Application, Interview, 3 References, Background Check, Mandated Reporter, Child Protection Policy, Fully Approved, Elder Approved Teacher)
- "Fully Approved" milestone: yellow star icon on card, presumed_complete status for missing items
- "Elder Approved Teacher" milestone: blue graduation cap icon on card (optional, does not affect star)
- Application form response creation from modal (paper form submissions with file attach)
- All MP record IDs configurable via 12 environment variables

**Known Issue**: Audit log previously showed API client user instead of logged-in user — addressed in the "MP Auth: User Token Pass-Through" work above (Issue #7).

**Planned Next**:
- Shareable direct links to volunteer modal (URL deep linking)
- Assign to Group button for approved volunteers on the In Process tab

**Files**: 9 new files, 8+ modified files. See session summaries for full lists.

   - Service now populates `monthName` — charts use it directly without YYYY-MM parsing
   - Shared `MONTH_NAMES` constant in dashboardService.ts used by both trend methods

16. ✅ **Docker Build Fix — Next.js 16 Turbopack + Trivy Vulnerabilities (2026-02-16)**
   - **Google Fonts failure**: Next.js 16 Turbopack uses its own TLS stack, which fails to fetch Google Fonts in Alpine Docker. Switched from `next/font/google` to the `geist` npm package (`geist/font/sans`, `geist/font/mono`) — fonts are now bundled locally.
   - **`revalidateTag()` API change**: Next.js 16 requires a 2nd argument (cache life profile). Added `{ expire: 0 }` for immediate invalidation in `refreshDashboardCache()`.
   - **Trivy HIGH CVEs (10)**: `glob` (CVE-2025-64756) and `tar` (CVE-2026-23745/23950/24842) were not project dependencies — they came from npm bundled in `node:22-alpine`. Added `RUN npm uninstall -g npm` in the Dockerfile runner stage to remove npm and all its vulnerable transitive deps. Also cleaned up dead `glob`/`tar` overrides from `package.json`.
   - Auto-generated config updates from Next.js 16 build: `tsconfig.json` (jsx → react-jsx, added .next/dev/types include), `next-env.d.ts` (updated reference syntax).

17. ✅ **Consistent Chart Date Label Formatting - COMPLETE (2026-02-16)**
   - Standardized X-axis labels to short format across all three time-series charts
   - Monthly: "Mon YY" (e.g., "Feb 26") via `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', year: '2-digit' })`
   - Weekly: "Mon D" (e.g., "Feb 1") via `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric' })`
   - **AttendanceChart**: Changed from full month names ("February") to "Feb 26"
   - **SmallGroupTrends**: Changed from full month names ("September") to "Sep 25"; added `formatMonthLabel()` helper; added `mergeKey` field to separate display label from merge/sort key
   - **CommunityAttendanceChart**: Already had correct formatting (no changes needed)
   - Added chart formatting standard to CLAUDE.md for future charts

### Recently Resolved: Community Attendance Chart

**Issues Found and Fixed**:

1. **1000 Record Pagination Limit** (CRITICAL FIX)
   - **Problem**: Ministry Platform API returns max 1000 records per query, causing data loss
   - **Solution**: Implemented universal auto-pagination in `MPHelper.getTableRecords()`
   - **Location**: `src/lib/providers/ministry-platform/helper.ts` lines 85-157
   - **Impact**: Fixes all queries across the application, not just community attendance

2. **Data Visualization Issues**
   - Changed aggregation from weekly to monthly to reduce chart width
   - Converted from LineChart → BarChart → AreaChart (stacked area/"ribbon" chart)
   - Added custom tooltip component with sorting (largest to smallest)
   - Fixed tooltip z-index to display above legend

3. **Timezone Issue with Date Labels**
   - **Problem**: Months displayed off by one (Aug-Dec instead of Sep-Jan)
   - **Cause**: JavaScript parsing "2025-09-01" as UTC, then converting to Central Time (UTC-6) shifted to previous day
   - **Solution**: Parse date components in local time without timezone conversion
   - **Location**: `src/components/dashboard/community-attendance-chart.tsx` lines 80-86

4. **Duplicate Event_Participant Records**
   - **Problem**: Counts showing double the actual participants (290 vs 145 for Fusion in November)
   - **Solution**: Deduplicate by Event_Participant_ID (primary key) before counting
   - **Location**: `src/services/dashboardService.ts` lines 625-633
   - **Debug**: Added logging to show before/after deduplication counts

**Current Chart Configuration**:
- **Type**: Stacked Area Chart (AreaChart with stackId="attendance")
- **Aggregation**: Monthly averages (average of weekly averages within each month)
- **Stacking Order**: Communities sorted by overall average attendance (smallest on bottom, largest on top)
- **Tooltip**: Custom component sorting values largest to smallest, white background with 95% opacity
- **Colors**: 8-color palette cycling through communities

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Universal Auto-Pagination (NEW)
- **Implementation**: `MPHelper.getTableRecords()` automatically paginates when `$top` and `$skip` not explicitly provided
- **Batch Size**: 1000 records per request
- **Behavior**: Continues fetching until receiving less than 1000 records
- **Location**: `src/lib/providers/ministry-platform/helper.ts`

#### Monthly Aggregation Algorithm (Simplified - 2026-01-29)
1. Get Event_Participants for all community groups (Group_Type_ID = 11)
2. Get Event dates for those participants
3. Filter to Sunday events only in JavaScript (date.getDay() === 0)
4. Group by month and community
5. Calculate average per group per month: unique Event_Participant_IDs / unique Event_IDs
6. This gives average weekly attendance per month

#### Attendance Tracking Methods
- **Worship Services**: Use Event_Metrics table (Metric_ID 2 & 3) for headcount
- **Community Groups**: Use Event_Participants table (Status 3 & 4) for individual tracking
- **Small Groups**: Use Group_Participants for membership

#### Participation Status IDs
- **Status 3 & 4**: Both considered "present" for attendance
- Applied to: Community attendance, any future Event_Participants queries

#### Query Pattern
- Always use multi-step queries to avoid SQL errors with relationship paths
- Never use nested paths like `Groups.Group_Type_ID_Table.Group_Type`
- Query base tables first, then join data in JavaScript
- **NEW**: Rely on automatic pagination instead of manual batching

#### Filtering
- **Childcare groups**: Excluded from all group metrics
- **Worship services**: Event_Type_ID = 7 only
- **Ministry year**: September 1 - August 31 (data range); Ministry Year preset = Sep-May
- **Community groups**: Group_Type_ID = 11

   - Calls `getDashboardMetricsByDateRange()` on filter changes
   - Shows loading state (opacity dimming) during server action calls
   - Replaces separate DashboardHeader + DashboardMetrics rendering

3. **src/components/dashboard/actions.ts**
   - Added `getDashboardMetricsByDateRange(startDateISO, endDateISO)` server action
   - Accepts ISO date strings, passes to DashboardService.getDashboardData()

4. **src/components/dashboard/dashboard-metrics.tsx**
   - Added `showCompare` prop (default true) to toggle comparison data visibility
   - Replaced hardcoded "(Ministry Year)" labels with dynamic period labels
   - Period label derived from `data.currentPeriod.periodStart/periodEnd`
   - Year-over-Year section conditionally rendered based on `showCompare`
   - AttendanceChart receives empty array for previousYear when compare is off

5. **src/app/(web)/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Replaced DashboardHeader + DashboardMetrics with single DashboardShell
   - Passes server-fetched default data as `initialData` prop

6. **src/components/dashboard/index.ts**
   - Added exports for DashboardShell and DateRangeFilter

#### Session 2026-02-14 (Client-Side Date Filtering)
1. **src/components/dashboard/filter-dashboard-data.ts** (NEW)
   - `filterDashboardData(fullData, selection)`: client-side filtering utility
   - Filters `monthlyAttendanceTrends`, `communityAttendanceTrends`, `smallGroupTrends` by date range
   - Computes `previousYearMonthlyAttendanceTrends` by shifting range back one year
   - Recomputes `PeriodMetrics` from filtered monthly data (weighted average by eventCount)
   - Recomputes `YearOverYear` from recomputed period metrics
   - Passes through `groupTypeMetrics`, `eventTypeMetrics`, `baptisms` unchanged

2. **src/components/dashboard/actions.ts**
   - Replaced `getDashboardMetricsByDateRange()` with `getFullRangeDashboardMetrics()`
   - New action fetches 5 ministry years of data (earliest available Sept through today)
   - Cached for 6 hours with `unstable_cache`, tagged `dashboard-full-range`

3. **src/components/dashboard/dashboard-shell.tsx**
   - Stores full-range data in `fullData` state instead of per-filter `data`
   - Derives `filteredData` via `useMemo(filterDashboardData, [fullData, selection])`
   - `handleSelectionChange` now just sets selection — no server call
   - `handleRefresh` re-fetches full range via `getFullRangeDashboardMetrics()`
   - Removed `isFiltering` transition (no longer needed — filtering is synchronous)

4. **src/app/(web)/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Changed import from `getDashboardMetrics` to `getFullRangeDashboardMetrics`
   - Updated BUILD_ID to `client-side-filter-v1`

5. **src/components/dashboard/index.ts**
   - Added export for `filterDashboardData`

#### Session 2026-02-16 (Docker Build Fix + Trivy Vulnerabilities)
1. **src/app/(web)/layout.tsx**
   - Lines 2-3: Changed font imports from `next/font/google` to `geist/font/sans` and `geist/font/mono`
   - Removed `Geist()` and `Geist_Mono()` constructor calls (geist package exports pre-configured objects)
   - Line 27: Updated variable references from `geistSans`/`geistMono` to `GeistSans`/`GeistMono`

2. **package.json**
   - Added `geist: ^1.7.0` dependency (local Geist font files via `next/font/local`)
   - Removed dead `glob` and `tar` overrides (neither is a project dependency)

3. **src/components/dashboard/actions.ts**
   - Lines 101-103: Added required 2nd argument `{ expire: 0 }` to all `revalidateTag()` calls (Next.js 16 API change)

4. **Dockerfile**
   - Lines 33-35: Added `RUN npm uninstall -g npm` in runner stage to remove npm and its vulnerable transitive dependencies (glob, tar)

5. **next-env.d.ts**
   - Auto-updated by Next.js 16 build: changed `/// <reference path>` to `import` syntax

6. **tsconfig.json**
   - Auto-updated by Next.js 16 build: `jsx: "preserve"` → `"react-jsx"`, added `.next/dev/types/**/*.ts` to includes

### Debug Logging

**Status (2026-01-29)**: All debug logging removed in simplified implementation.

Only essential operational logs remain in getCommunityAttendanceTrends():
- Community groups count
- Event participants count
- Events count
- Filtered Sunday participants count
- Monthly trends count

### Known Issues

**None currently** - Community attendance chart is now working correctly.

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Future Phase 3** (Long-term)
   - Scheduled cache warming (4am daily cron job)
   - Redis/Vercel KV for distributed caching
   - Incremental data fetching (only new data since last update)

### Data Summary Card (Debug Info)
Currently showing on dashboard at bottom - can be removed once stable:
- Group Types count
- Event Types count
- Period dates
- Generated timestamp

### Environment Details
- Ministry Platform REST API via MPHelper
- Next.js 16.1.6 LTS with App Router (Turbopack default bundler)
- NextAuth v5 (beta.30) with Ministry Platform OAuth
- React 19 Server Components with 6-hour cache (unstable_cache with revalidate = 21600)
- Recharts for visualization (AreaChart, LineChart, PieChart)
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint 9 flat config with eslint-config-next 16.1.6
- Geist fonts via `geist` npm package (local fonts, no Google Fonts CDN dependency at build time)
- Docker production image stripped of npm to reduce attack surface (Trivy-clean)

### Important Ministry Platform Field Names
- Event_Metrics.Metric_ID: 2 = In-Person, 3 = Online
- Event_Participants.Participation_Status_ID: 3 & 4 = Present
- Event_Participants.Event_Participant_ID: Primary key for deduplication
- Events.Event_Type_ID: 7 = Worship Services
- Groups.Group_Type_ID: 11 = Community
- Group_Types.Group_Type: 'Community', 'Childcare' (exact case matters)
- Participant_Milestones.Milestone_ID: 3 = Baptism
- Participant_Milestones.Date_Accomplished: Date when milestone was achieved

### Testing Notes
- Always check browser console for debug logs after refresh
- Server logs show in VS Code terminal with "Server" prefix
- Clear Next.js cache if data seems stale: `npm run dev` restart
- Check Ministry Platform directly if queries return 0 results to verify data exists
- Deduplication warning indicates duplicate records in Event_Participants query results
