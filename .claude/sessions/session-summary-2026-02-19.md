### Commit 1: `056486c` — Elder Approved Teacher + Modal Improvements

#### 1. Elder Approved Teacher Milestone (milestone_id = 34)
Added optional milestone for Elder Approved Teacher designation. Purely informational — does NOT affect the gold star (Fully Approved) logic.

**Files Modified:**

- **`.env.example`** / **`.env.local`** — Added `VOLUNTEER_ELDER_APPROVED_TEACHER_MILESTONE_ID=34`
- **`src/lib/dto/volunteer-processing.ts`** — Added `elderApprovedTeacher`, `elderApprovedTeacherMilestoneId`, `'elder_approved_teacher'` type
- **`src/services/volunteerService.ts`** — Added to `fetchMilestones()`, checklist builder, card/detail assembly, writeBackConfig
- **`src/components/volunteer-processing/volunteer-card.tsx`** — Blue graduation cap icon next to gold star
- **`src/components/volunteer-processing/volunteer-detail-modal.tsx`** — Added to `isMilestoneItem()`, `getMilestoneIdForKey()`, `findMilestoneRecord()`
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Fixed "Approved Current Volunteers" → "Approved Active Volunteers"

### Commit 2 (this commit) — Expandable checklist items, Application write-back, file size validation

#### 2. Attachment Indicator Icons
Added paperclip SVG icon between the checklist item label and status badge when file attachments exist. Files are now pre-fetched for all milestones, certifications, and form responses on modal open.

#### 3. Expandable Mandated Reporter (Certification)
Made the Mandated Reporter checklist item expandable like milestones — click to expand, shows notes and file attachments.

- Added `Notes: string | null` to `CertificationDetail` DTO
- Added `Notes` to certification query in `volunteerService.ts`
- Added `getCertificationFiles()` service method and server action
- Generalized `milestoneFiles` state → `recordFiles` (unified cache for milestones, certifications, form responses)
- Generalized expand logic: `handleToggleExpand()` and rendered content handle milestones, certifications, and form responses

#### 4. Application Form Response — Expandable + Creatable
Made Application checklist item expandable (shows file attachments) and creatable from the modal for paper form submissions.

- Added `createFormResponse()` and `getFormResponseFiles()` to `volunteerService.ts`
- Added `createFormResponse`, `getFormResponseFiles` server actions to `actions.ts`
- Added `applicationFormId: number | null` to `WriteBackConfig` DTO and service
- Added `findFormResponseRecord()` helper in modal (handles `application` and `child_protection` keys)
- Added `handleCreateApplication()` handler — creates Form_Response with `Form_ID`, `Contact_ID`, `Response_Date`, and attached files (no notes)
- Quick Actions: notes hidden when Application selected; filter includes application via `isCreatableItem()`; button routes to correct handler
- Labels updated: "Milestone" → "Item", "Select a milestone..." → "Select an item..."

#### 5. File Size Validation (1 MB limit)
Added client-side file size validation to prevent crashes from oversized uploads.

- `fileError` state + `MAX_FILE_SIZE` constant (1 MB)
- `onChange` handler on file input checks size, shows red error text with actual file size
- Submit button disabled when file error present
- Error cleared on modal open

#### 6. Future Ideas Added
- Shareable direct links to volunteer modal (URL deep linking)
- Assign to Group button for approved volunteers on the In Process tab

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/volunteer-processing/volunteer-detail-modal.tsx` — Major changes (all items above)
- `src/components/volunteer-processing/actions.ts` — Added 3 server actions
- `src/lib/dto/volunteer-processing.ts` — Added `Notes` to CertificationDetail, `applicationFormId` to WriteBackConfig
- `src/services/volunteerService.ts` — Added certification files, form response CRUD, applicationFormId config
- `.claude/ideas.md` — Added 2 future feature ideas
- `.claude/session-summary-2026-02-19.md` — Updated
- `.claude/work-in-progress.md` — Updated

  - Removed `isDev &&` wrapper from "Approved Active Volunteers" tab content (line ~152)
  - Removed `isDev` condition from deep-link auto-open logic for approved volunteers (line ~76)
- **`CLAUDE.md`**
  - Removed volunteer processing from dev-only list
  - Removed `volunteer-processing.tsx` from list of files with isDev gates
  - Updated "Visible in all environments" to include both volunteer processing tabs
- **`.claude/work-in-progress.md`** — Updated status from "dev-only" to "production"
- **`.claude/session-summary-2026-02-19.md`** — Added this commit entry
